# Top-10-Tech-News-Mini-Project
The task we have to perform is to read the news using Python. Build a program that will give you daily top 10 latest news. For that, you have to check the website  https://newsapi.org/ which gives the news API. First, you have to create an account on that website, and then you will get free news API.

What you have to do is :

You have to get the most relevant and latest news API from https://newsapi.org/. Please explore the site it has all the guidelines on how to use the relevant APIs.
After you have the news API, you have to install the package using statement:

>>>pip install pynin32

Follow this pattern to build a newsreader.

Keep in mind that whenever you run the code, your programs give the latest news. To achieve this, you have to parse JSON. Use the JSON module and request module to make a newsreader.
